This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# REDUX
 - Action : Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. You send them to the store using store.dispatch()
 -Actions are plain JavaScript objects. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed. Types should typically be defined as string constants

```javascript
const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'
{
  type: ADD_TODO,
  text: 'Build my first Redux app'
}
```

- Action Creators : Action creators are exactly that—functions that create actions.
- To initiate a dispatch, pass the result to the dispatch() function like below: 

```javascript
dispatch(addTodo(text))
dispatch(completeTodo(index))
```
Alternatively, you can create a bound action creator that automatically dispatches:

```javascript
const boundAddTodo = text => dispatch(addTodo(text))
const boundCompleteTodo = index => dispatch(completeTodo(index))

// In order to call them 
boundAddTodo(text)
boundCompleteTodo(index)
```

- The dispatch() function can be accessed directly from the store as store.dispatch(), but more likely you'll access it using a helper like react-redux's connect(). You can use bindActionCreators() to automatically bind many action creators to a dispatch() function.

```javascript
function addTodo(text) {
  return {
    type: ADD_TODO,
    text
  }
}
```
